# kata-project

A simple project for developers new to vue to build and rebuild in times they have very little time to code so that they retain some of the basic knowledge.

Project should have three inputs (x, y, radius)
changing the inputs should change the size and position of a circle in an svg element.

The app should use two components.
1. a text input component for the user to enter text. This component should have two props (name, startValue). It should emit the value when it changes.
2. an svg component that has an svg element that moves and resizes a circle element. It should have three props (x, y, radius)

See the branch 'copleted state' to see the app in a completed state
